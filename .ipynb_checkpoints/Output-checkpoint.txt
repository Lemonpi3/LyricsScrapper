Fires rise from burning shells of what once used to be
On cobalt streets temptation sparks like electricity
Born of man and of machine, these two worlds hybridize
Truth and lie amplify and rage behind my eyes

Agony, wrong and right, all I see black and white
Calling me, Dark and Light, who's the enemy?
Who's the enemy?

The pressure building in between
Can someone help me choose between
The Darkness and the Light?

Halo of fire falls from the sky
Burning a thousand sins, purified
Freed from captivity, shake off the demons of unreason
Child of fire, born again

Like fire from the Sun
In bursts of flames the Phoenix dies
But life has only just begun
From the ashes you will rise

You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix)
You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix)
You are Phoenix (you are Phoenix, you are Phoenix)

Another life begins sanctified
Freed from a thousand sins that have died
Fear no uncertainty, anxiety or unbelievers
Spread wings of fire, born again

In bursts of flames the Phoenix dies
But life has only just begun

A consequence of technology
Colliding head on into disgraced humanity
Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right
Constantly torn between the Darkness and the Light

Enemies raging behind my eyes
Shadows caress me while whispering their lies
Hell calls my name as the Heavens cry
I don't know what to do so I keep praying for the end of time
(The end of time)

Fade into this waking dream
As darkness falls
On our own, it's you and me, baby
When the writing's on the wall

We walk in the daylight
Consumed by the sprawl
We know that the darkness is coming
'Cause the writing's on the wall
We talk in the twilight
And wait for rain to fall
On our own, we face what is coming
'Cause the writing's on the wall

Fade into this waking dream
As darkness falls
On our own, it's you and me, baby
When the writing's on the wall

We cling to the outline
Of these buildings tall
In New York, the skyline is falling
'Cause the writing's on the wall
We are future bloodline
We're living once and for all
We wait for the darkness that's coming

Two lost souls fading into the sprawl
Afterglow and living under midnight
It's you and me, nothing else matters at all

I'm always with you, high and low, everywhere you go
Through darkness and light you'll see, you know where I will be
Everywhere you, everywhere you

The city lights, they bleed into the distance
Our minds and bodies bleeding into one
And if you look back you will see two sets of footprints
You're next to me, you are my Aphelion
